  Hello! As was mentioned, I’m a computer science student pursuing a second degree. My first degree was a B.A. (Hons.) in philosophy. 
  After I graduated in June of 2019, I ended up in a job for a career path I did not expect myself to be in, nor was it one 
  I really wanted to be in. I decided to give it some time to think about, and when the pandemic started that only allowed me 
  more time with my thoughts. I started my journey for my second degree at the beginning of 2021. 
  <br><br>
  I like to think the motivations that drew me to computer science were the same ones that compelled 
  me to continue my philosophy degree (the only reason, at first, was to try and get into law school). Dealing with the abstract, 
  constantly looking for solutions that may not actually be correct, the pursuit of precision and accuracy. Philosophical arguments
  and well-written code, in my mind, are done with similar intentions. I’ve always enjoyed using my creativity to look beyond the
  obvious, and I think both philosophy and computer science require a certain amount of creativity, if not to find a solution,
  then at least to have fun with it all. 
  <br><br>
  My path to becoming a computer science student was an interesting one, I’d like to think. Coming out of high school I thought I 
  wanted to become a pharmacist. "But then, actually", I wanted to be a lawyer. "No, scratch that, I’m really enjoying working for the 
  student newspaper, maybe a journalist?" "Hmm, well this stuff I'm doing for the newspaper now, podcasting and <a href="videocontent.html">video content</a>, is 
  pretty fun. Let’s try and turn that into a career instead!" "Wow, this public service job pays pretty well... but I'm not sure if it’s the job for me..."
  <br><br>
  And here we are, on the “About Me” section of my very barebones website that I’m kind of proud to have coded up myself. 
  <br><br>
  Outside of my career aspirations, I have a number of hobbies and interests. I’m a big sports fan, though I’ve transitioned from being a 
  hardcore fan of one team, to a genuine fan of all sports, enjoying the chaos and randomness that can come with every game. If I 
  had to pick a favourite sport, it would be baseball. I love the sport so much, I even wrote about the MLB for a short period for 
  my aforementioned student newspaper. I’ve always loved listening to all different genres of music, where “not into mainstream”
  became my personality for a little while, but I’ve toned that down especially nowadays, and I’d much rather discuss and learn about 
  different people’s music tastes. While I definitely lean towards the hip-hop/rap genre, I think you’d enjoy <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/jgonzalesss?si=058b496f11e74327">seeing the different playlists I keep on deck</a>. I've always been fascinated by the field of astronomy, and I'd like to think that in a different timeline,
  I was really good at theoretical physics and ended up working for NASA. I suppose enjoying the grandeurs of the universe through observation
  will do just fine, because at least I can share that feeling with almost everyone I meet.
  <br><br>
  I’ve been on a sort of mental health journey. I picked up yoga at the start of the pandemic, and then started meditating near the end 
  of 2021. Working with my therapist, I realized I have always been an especially anxious person, though of course living through a
  pandemic doesn’t help that a lot. Still, it’s been a lot of work of being more present and acknowledging my emotions, work that I’m proud of doing for myself. 
  <br><br>
  If you’ve read this far, thank you. I could have written a thousand more words and then some talking about myself, but maybe you and
  I could eventually meet and you can learn more about me while I learn everything about you. Cheers! </p>
